# Getting Started

Welcome to the Simple Docs MVP! This documentation will help you get up and running quickly.

## What is Simple Docs MVP?

Simple Docs MVP is a minimal documentation site generator that converts Markdown files into a static HTML website. It's designed to be:

*   **Simple** - Easy to set up and use
*   **Fast** - Quick builds with Python Markdown
*   **Flexible** - Easy to customize and extend
*   **Portable** - Static HTML output works anywhere

## Key Features

### Markdown Support

Write your documentation in standard Markdown syntax with support for:

*   Headings
*   Lists (ordered and unordered)
*   Code blocks
*   Tables
*   Links and images
*   And more!

### Table of Contents

Organize your documentation with a YAML-based table of contents that automatically generates navigation.

### Static Output

The build process generates pure HTML files that can be:

*   Hosted on any web server
*   Deployed to GitHub Pages
*   Served from a CDN
*   Viewed locally without a server
